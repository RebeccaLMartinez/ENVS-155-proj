# A Community-Centered Vision

We propose transforming underused spaces across Lompoc into a network of edible walking trails — places where people can connect, move, and nourish themselves in every sense.

# What Is the Edible Trail?

::: {.card .p-4 .mb-4}
The Edible Trail is a proposed series of green corridors filled with edible and native plants — designed with community input to reflect local needs, culture, and environment.

Each trail would include:

🍊 Edible landscaping (fruit trees, herbs, native plants)

🌳 Shade, seating, and safe walking paths

🎨 Community-led design, art, and signage

🤝 Hands-on engagement through workshops and planting days

# 📍 Why Lompoc?

Lompoc is rich in open space and community pride — yet many green spaces feel disconnected, underutilized, or unsafe. Community feedback has emphasized the need for:

- Safer, more walkable neighborhoods

- Intergenerational gathering spaces

- Access to fresh food and nature

- Community-driven projects that build trust and pride

The Edible Trail proposal responds to those needs while supporting health, equity, and climate resilience.
